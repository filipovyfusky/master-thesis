\chapter{Research and theory}
\label{research}
The first part of this section gives a thorough introduction to neural networks (NN) in general. It begins by definition of fundamental terms needed to fully understand the core principles of NNs. Due to the fact that the research in this area is still heavily ongoing, the more advanced techniques described here may soon be out of date or replaced by better-performing ones and therefore the theoretical background is limited only to the extent relevant for the particular chosen network architecture. Still, it will give a solid foundation needed to understand other similar approaches.
